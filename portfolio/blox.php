				<p>The USP of blox is that it is made from one mold, allowing it to be a much more cost effective product in terms of manufacturing. This is not the only quality which saves on costs. Shipping has been made easy by allowing drawers to nest inside one another, whilst enclosed in the blox parts. The blox themselves are assembled via tongue and groove injection moulded joints. Blox works by having connectors on the top and bottom of the product which enables users to link multiple blox together to create a product based on their storage/spacial needs.</p>
