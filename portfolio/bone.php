Bone is extremely intuitive and can be used by anyone. It works in a similar way to standard wireless headphones. The main difference is that it sits behind the ear rather than on it. This means that the actual product itself is completely hidden from front view. From the side, it looks like a standard thin hairband (which can be covered by hair.) This means it would not look out of place when used.';

				<p class="caption">Over 466 million people in the world suffer from disabling hearing loss (with that number estimated to grow to 900 million by 2050). Furthermore, 60% of childhood hearing loss cases are due to preventable causes. This begs the question - how can those who suffer from hearing loss share similar experiences to what non-deaf individuals experience (without an obvious accessory such as a hearing aid)?</p>

				<h2>What is the "Sense" range?</h2>
				<p class="caption">People need products they can relate to, products that play a vital role in their life, products that consider human emotions. "Sense" is a collection of products which focus on making technology less intimidating. It uses relatable design via form, colours, materials and finishes to achieve this. The products are viewed as a human companion rather than a tech attachment. The aim is not to create new devices, but to design the products that have been missing from people's lives.</p>

			<div class=portfolio_information>
				<p>There are 2 types of conductive hearing loss – mid ear and outer ear. Fortunately, the inner ear works fine but sound from the outside world has difficulty entering. Therefore, bone conduction technology allows sound to send vibrations through the skull so sound can directly travel to the inner ear – bypassing the need to travel via the outer and mid ear. “Bone” is extremely intuitive and can be used by anyone. It works in a similar way to standard wireless headphones and includes the following features;</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Connect to devices via Bluetooth.
					</li>
					<li>
						Touch sensitive playback controls.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wireless charging. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The main difference is that it sits behind the ear rather than on it. This means that the actual product itself is completely hidden from front view. From the side, it shares a similar aesthetic to a standard thin hairband which can be covered by hair. Bone is the ideal solution for any scenario or envionrment</p>
