				<p>Children are oblivious to the detriment of the environment. They are also not concerned about problems outside of themselves. This is why they care so little for the environment. Forcing them to choose between fun, or environmental conservation is a statement with an obvious answer. However, by integrating conservation with play, the child has no choice but to subliminally help save the world.</p>
				<p>Parts of the toy can be traded to allow the child to feel unique.</p>
				<p>The Alienus toy concept aims to achieve minimal toy wastage by also integrating the packaging into play via a range of various different processes;</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The bottom of the packaging is a landing pad for the remote controlled flying toy which introduces an educational element (hand-eye coordination) and a goal to the game.
					</li>
					<li>
						The packaging is used to store all the parts which build to construct a complete toy (UFO)
					</li>
					<li>
						The controller for the toy slots on top of the packaging
					</li>
				</ul>
