				<p>By creating Catch, it allows individuals to be self sufficient with an easy indication device. Due to limited infrastructure in many developing countries, sometimes people can live miles away from the nearest aid station or hospital. Catch can ensure that it is not a wasted trip and allows an easy blood extraction process. It works by;</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Sliding the tight sleeve over the finger until it reaches the finger stopper. This sleeve has half of the inside coated with disinfectant (which has removable packaging to keep it clean). The other half is dry to clean off the disinfectant residue.
					</li>
					<li>
						Push down on the pipette. This will also push down on the small needle. When the pipette is released, it will collect the blood.
					</li>
					<li>
						Press the latch on the front to release the blood which will then travel onto the absorbent indicator. This may show 2 lines; The first will indicate the test is working, the second will detect if the individual has HIV in their blood.
					</li>
