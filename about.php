			<div class="about">
				<p>Currently working as a <strong>Senior Industrial Designer</strong> at LUMA-iD. Please also get in touch for <strong>freelance</strong> opportunities.</p>
				<br>
				<p> I am a designer living in London with a great passion for creating beautiful products.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Recognition I have received include; <strong>"Emerging Designer of the Year", "Industrial Designer of the Year" and "Top 10 Designers in the world under the age of 30".</strong></p>
				<br>
				<p> Since graduating with a First Class Honors (GPA: 4.0) degree in Industrial Design, I have gained experience working for several design companies as well as undertaking freelance work. My methodology has evolved greatly and it is my mission to continue this growth.</p>
				<br>
				<p> If you also share my adulation of Product Design, or perhaps would like to work with me,  please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:mail@hansramzan.com">get in touch.</a></p>

			<div class="about">
				<h2>Design Ethos</h2>
				<p>As a <strong>human-centred designer</strong>, the user should always be at the centre of any solution. I believe in designing <strong>meaningful experiences</strong> that have a positive impact on the world. I am a <strong>critical and analytical thinker</strong> who is able to discover and define issues, which can then be developed into a quality solution.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I thrive in engaging in conversation with <strong>passionate</strong> people whom have <strong>empathy</strong> and admiration for <strong>varying points of view</strong>. My philosophy of design stems from a deep fascination of not only how products work, but also questioning <strong>why</strong>. Every product should solve a problem and add <strong>value</strong> to life.</p>
				<br>
				<p>My inspirations lie within remarkable designers such as <strong>Rams, Da Vinci, Ive and Eames</strong>. It is more the <strong>design philosophy</strong> over the aesthetic that I admire most. I attempt to encompass <strong>intuition, intelligence and innovation</strong> in all my work.</p>
